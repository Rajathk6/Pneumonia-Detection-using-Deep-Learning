# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

### 📌 **Overview**

This project leverages deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. It utilizes the MobileNet model for image classification, deployed via a Flask web application. Users can upload an X-ray image, and the system will predict whether the patient has pneumonia or not, along with a confidence score.

###  🚀 **Features**

✅ Deep Learning Model: MobileNet-based classification for pneumonia detection

✅ Web Interface: Simple Flask-based UI for image upload and prediction

✅ Real-Time Predictions: Instant classification results with confidence percentages

✅ User-Friendly Output: Displays both uploaded image and model's decision

###  🛠️ **Tech Stack**

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras (MobileNet)

Deployment: Localhost

### 📊 **Model and Dataset**

Dataset: Chest X-ray images sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Model: MobileNet fine-tuned on pneumonia detection

### 🖼️ **Usage**

1️⃣ Upload a chest X-ray image

2️⃣ Click "Predict"

3️⃣ View the classification result (Pneumonia / No Pneumonia) with confidence score
